## Forget
It’s very easy to forget something when you do not use it for a long time. I have not written the blog on the jekyll for several weeks, I even forget how to start the jekyll server on local.  
`jekyll serve` in the blog folder  
And this time I met a error,  
`[2016-09-03 10:31:16] WARN  TCPServer Error: Address already in use - bind(2)`  
` jekyll 3.1.2 | Error:  Address already in use - bind(2)`

Yes, the port is used by other app, try another  
`jekyll serve --watch --port 4444`  
I think it’s good.  

## Recently
I met some big problem, I hope it was finished.  
Everything will be better!

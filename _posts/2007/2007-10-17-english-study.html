<p>My fish told me that her foreign teacher Kim said her English is the best in their department. And she get in the red class for study English.</p>

<p>Of course, I know Fish's English is very good. Her CET4 is 89 and CET6 is 80. Her English is much better than mine. I think I should study English. Because I have a good English teacher, and more important is I have a good wife.</p>
<p>It's my best lucky in MyLife.</p>

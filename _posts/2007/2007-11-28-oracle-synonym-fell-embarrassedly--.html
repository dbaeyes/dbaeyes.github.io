<p>I feel very embarrassedly, when I konw the mean of the Oracle Synonym. Because I confused by the table which not contain in our DB, bu I can select/insert/update the data in the table. Then I found the table in another db. I really confused by that. This table used a synonym for table by dblink.</p>

<p>This is what I found in the Web.</p>

<p>问题描述：<br />
有两个oralce数据库<br />
SID分别为 A B<br />
A中a用户下含有表objects<br />
B中含有b用户<br />
使在B中用b用户登录后执行<br />
select * from objects<br />
能显示出A中a.objects的全部内容</p>
<p>问题解答：<br />
用b用户登录到B中，执行：<br />
create public synonym objects for a.objects@A<br />
此时执行select * from objects 就能显示出a.objects的全部内容</p>
<p>需要注意的一点：<br />
B中不能含有table b.objects否则语句可以执行，但是执行select操作时显示的仍然为b.objects的内容，需要先把b.objects删除掉，重新建立synonym即可。</p>

<p>A synonym is an alias for a schema object. Synonyms can provide a level of ecurity by masking the name and owner of an object and by providing location transparency for remote objects of a distributed database. Also, they are convenient to use and reduce the complexity of SQL statements for database users.<br />
Synonyms allow underlying objects to be renamed or moved, where only the synonym needs to be redefined and applications based on the synonym continue to function without modification.<br />
You can create both public and private synonyms. A public synonym is owned by the special user group named PUBLIC and is accessible to every user in a database.<br />
A private synonym is contained in the schema of a specific user and available only<br />
to the user and the user’s grantees.</p>

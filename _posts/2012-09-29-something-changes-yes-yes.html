<p>Something was changed in my work these days. I think it is useful and important.</p>
<p>1. adjust some variables in mysql, it looks good for database.</p>
<p>2. adjust the huge page, turn off</p>
<p>3. reboot / restart</p>
<p>4. the slave was stop, because :MySQL Replication Fatal Error 1236 . Fix it by google.</p>
<p>Maybe there are many mistake in the passage. I just try to write in English. English is so important for me.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>These day I got to sleep to late, It is very terrible.</p>
<p>Must change from now on.</p>

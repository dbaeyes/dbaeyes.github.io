<div>Classic Oracle Index Myths<br />
Oracle B-tree indexes can become “unbalanced” over time and need to be rebuilt<br />
Deleted space in an index is “deadwood” and over time requires the index to be rebuilt<br />
If an index reaches “x” number of levels, it becomes inefficient and requires the index to be rebuilt<br />
If an index has a poor clustering factor, the index needs to be rebuilt<br />
To improve performance, indexes need to be regularly rebuilt</p>
<p>Index Fundamentals<br />
Oracle’s implements a form of B*Tree index<br />
Oracle’s B-Tree index is always balanced. Always.<br />
Index entries must always be ordered.<br />
An update consists of a delete and an insert<br />
Each leaf block has pointers to next/previous blocks<br />
Each leaf block contains the index entry with corresponding rowid<br />
Index scans use ‘sequential’, single block reads(with exception of Fast Full Index Scan)</p>
<p>Index Rebuilds<br />
? As discussed, most indexes are efficient at allocating and reusing space<br />
? Randomly inserted indexes operate at average 25% free space<br />
? Monotonically increasing indexes operate at close to 0% free space<br />
? Deleted space is generally reusable<br />
? Only in specific scenarios could unused space be expected to be higher    and remain unusable<br />
? So when may index rebuilds be necessary ?</p>
<p>Conditions for Rebuilds<br />
Large free space (generally 50%+), which indexes rarely reach, and<br />
Large selectivity, which most index accesses never reach, and<br />
Response times are adversely affected, which rarely are.<br />
Note requirement of some free space anyways to avoid insert and subsequent free space issues<br />
Benefit of rebuild based on various dependencies which include:<br />
– Size of index<br />
– Clustering Factor<br />
– Caching characteristics<br />
– Frequency of index accesses<br />
– Selectivity (cardinality) of index accesses<br />
– Range of selectivity (random or specific range)<br />
– Efficiency of dependent SQL<br />
– Fragmentation characteristics (does it effect portion of index frequently used)<br />
– I/O characteristics of index  (serve contention or I/O bottlenecks)<br />
– The list goes on and on ….</p>
<p>Other Rebuild Issues To Consider Other Rebuild Issues To Consider<br />
More efficient index structures can reduce stress on buffer cache. Harder to formulate but requires consideration<br />
If you have the resources and you have the appropriate maintenance window, then the cost vs. benefit equation more favorable to rebuild<br />
– Benefit maybe low but perhaps so is the relative cost<br />
Rebuild or Coalesce ?</p>
<p>Index Coalesce<br />
More efficient, less resource intensive, less<br />
locking issues than rebuild option<br />
Can significantly reduce number of leaf blocks in<br />
some scenarios<br />
Requires sum of free space to exceed 50% +<br />
pctfree in consecutive leaf blocks<br />
However, as generally needs excessive 50%+<br />
freespace for rebuild to be effective<br />
Does not reduce index height<br />

<p>Summary<br />
The vast majority of indexes do not require rebuilding<br />
Oracle B-tree indexes can become “unbalanced” and need to be rebuilt is a myth<br />
Deleted space in an index is “deadwood” and over time requires the index to be rebuilt is a myth<br />
If an index reaches “x” number of levels, it becomes inefficient and requires the index to be rebuilt is a myth<br />
If an index has a poor clustering factor, the index needs to be rebuilt is a myth<br />
To improve performance, indexes need to be regularly rebuilt is a myth</p>

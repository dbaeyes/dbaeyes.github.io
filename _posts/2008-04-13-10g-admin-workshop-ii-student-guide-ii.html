<h1></h1>
<div>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: medium;"><strong>I don't think the book "Admin Workshop II" worths reading by myself after a time of study. It's too simple for concept and explain. Maybe it's not a good ideal when I not finished it. But I thinks if I finish it not clearly and waste a lot time, I'm really fool!</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff6600; font-size: medium;"><strong>I will read the Student Guide II from now on, I hope I can finish it this month. Then I will go and pass the 1Z043 test.</strong></span></p>
